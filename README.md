# photo_organizer
A simple node.js application for merging photos from different sources.
All files from input sources are renamed and put into output folder. Sorting is performed by "date taken" from exif metadata.
Allows filtering files via extensions (by default only looks for .jpg files).
Created and tested in Windows environment.
